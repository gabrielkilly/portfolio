#2 Write a data structure for representing disjoint sets.

template<typename T>
class DisjointSet {
    public:
        DisjointSet(const T &data);
        void unionSets(DisjointSet &ds);
        const T &getMarker();
};

Put your code in a file called DisjointSet.h. Note that the way I have these methods set up with "getMarker" you probably want to have the "Find-Set" method from the book in your class as a private method that helps the others.
