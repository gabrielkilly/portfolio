#1 - For this problem you will write a cell division discrete event simulation that is based on a research project done in the math department a number of years ago looking at population growth in cell cultures. The code you submit needs to have a function with the following signature.

int numCells(double endTime, double minSplit, double maxSplit);

At time 0 you start with one cell and it splits immediately. Each time a cell splits, both halves will split again at some random time in the future. That time between splits is uniformly distributed between minSplit and maxSplit. Each cell from a split will use a different random value for its next split time. I want you to generate the random value using the following expression. maxSplit > minSplit > 0

minSplit + rand()*(maxSplit-minSplit)/RAND_MAX;

Both rand and RAND_MAX are defined in cstdlib. Do NOT call srand in the code you submit. I will be setting the seed myself for testing purposes. Your function should return the number of cells you have when the next split time is greater than endTime.

Note that for your function to return the same answer as mine, you have to pull random numbers for splits in the order that the cells split.
